### functions achieved

You could uncomment my commented test code snippet and run _node-myDB_
to test the DB crud operations. It runs smoothly.

### problem encountered

In config/myDB.js, I tested the CRUD operations and it runs smoothly. Afer I export myDB
and run it in route/users.js, it does work and the error message shows 'User table does not exist'
in the DB which is super weird and confusing...

### first install

please run _npm-i_
then run _npm-run-server_ in the terminal
then enjoy
