## problem encountered

In config/myDB.js, I tested the CRUD operations and it runs smoothly. Afer I export myDB
and run it in route/users.js, it does work and the error message shows 'User table does not exist'
in the DB which is super weird and confusing...

## first install

please run _npm-i_
then run _npm-run-server_ in the terminal
then enjoy
